# Wizzi Legacy

This module contains schemas and artifacts of a previous private version
of the Wizzi Factory necessary to bootstrap the new version.

It will be eliminated when the bootstrap is succesfull.

## The 'js' schema

To write javascript code in Ittf format is quite clumsy, but the
'js' schema is for codifying javascript templates and 
Ittf template commands are very handy for that job.

## The 'js/module' artifact

Generates a javascript source from an Ittf model conformant 
to the 'js' schema.

## The Wizzi Factory

A set of tools for model driven programming.

## Work still in progress

Availability of the firsts generators will be announced 
on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wizziteam) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wizzifactory).
