# Wizzi Ittf

The model and template engine of the Wizzi factory.

## The ITTF notation

In the Wizzi Factory models and templates are text documents coded using
an Indented Text Tree Format. 

###Example
<pre>
001	rdbms
002		table User
003			column Name
004			column EMail
</pre>

Every model can be templated and there is no formal difference between 
models and templates.

## The trasformation process from an Ittf document to a Wizzi model

Artifact generators are driven by Wizzi models. A Wizzi model is a 
typed tree structure and must be verified against a Schema.

An Ittf document is a schemaless tree structure. Each node has simply a name, a value 
and zero or more children. It can contain expressions, conditioned tree branches and
can be mixed with others Ittf documents.

The load process of an Ittf documents kicks off trasformations, mixups, compositions of branches and
merging of context data. The resulting Ittf model must be conformant to a Schema in order to
be loaded into a Wizzi model.

A Wizzi model can then be used to generate artifacts.

## The Wizzi Factory

A set of tools for model driven programming.
